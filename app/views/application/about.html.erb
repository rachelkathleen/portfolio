    <p>I was born in Los Angeles and raised in New York. I've traveled to over 90 countries,
      logged 3000+ dives, and climbed eight volcanos in an effort to make a life out of
      one in a lifetime experiences.  To borrow from George Carlin, "And always remember,
      life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by those moments that take
      our breath away."</p>
    <p>I've learned to code for the opportunity to make and maintain beautiful,
      well-designed things with intelligent people that can have a meaningful impact
      on people or businesses.</p>
